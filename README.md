MemRat a.k.a MemWare (v2) is a quite simple rat designed to be used through a Discord Bot. 

The main functions include:
 - Uploading (and executing) files
 - Stealing tokens on request
 - Annoying the victim
 - Being remote controlled
 
The rat IS DETECTABLE (haven't tested, but most likely) because the coder (me) sucks ass. It's for educational purposes only anyway so not that you'd be able to use it.
